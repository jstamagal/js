Version-current library documentation via Context7: exact syntax, config keys,
migration paths for a library, framework, SDK, or API. It resolves `library` to Context7's best match and
returns documentation snippets with source URLs. Context7 matches keywords, so a
hit is reported only when the requested name, case and separators ignored, is
the hit's project name (an id path segment or its title) or one whole word of
it. Anything else comes back as no match rather than as an unrelated project's
docs. Set `topic`; an untargeted dump is long.
{{#if serper_search}}
